ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores binary classification of vertebral column data using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset, originally compiled by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residency in Lyon, France, contains six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine.

We reformulate the original dataset into a binary task:

Normal (NO) â†’ 0

Abnormal (AB, including DH & SL) â†’ 1

The goal is to implement, analyze, and compare different distance metrics, training sizes, and voting strategies for KNN.
